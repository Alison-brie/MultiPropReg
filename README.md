This is the official code for "Learning Deformable Image Registration from Optimization: Perspective, Modules, Bilevel Training and Beyond"
![Alt text](pipeline.png)


# Requirements

> Python == 3.6.8, PyTorch == 0.3.1, torchvision == 0.2.0  <br>

> Note: PyTorch 0.4 is not supported at this moment and would lead to OOM.  <br>


# Pretrained models

> The easiest way to get started is to evaluate our trained models, run

> <p> <code>python test.py</code> </p>
